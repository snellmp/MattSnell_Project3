					<p>It’s a pretty sweet racket. You get to travel the country making a small fortune with your unique and desirable product. The bugs are lizards if you want to get technical. Specifically, chameleons. But the Lizardman was already taken by some guy in the sideshow, so okay: Bugman. Factual or not it has rhythm.</p>

					<p>Your job description: Set up on the midway, close to the big top. As kids come dragging their parents through, start barking about the mystical magical marvels of nature you’ll pin to their shirt for seventy-five cents. You’ve got a big old board to display the wares, and you of all people can attest it is not easy to tie twenty-four squirming chameleons to safety pins. But you got good at it and you set them up and hope the weather’s good enough they’ll start firing around in circles like a bunch of tiny clocks. In the right crowd you make money hand over first.</p>

					<p>Like any business, there’s a certain amount of overhead. Bugs themselves are fifteen cents a pop. Then there’s travel and accommodations, because you don’t have a berth with the circus. So far it's been trailing only for you. You trail behind the circuses and work their crowd without an official contract. Not exactly kosher as far as the management’s concerned, but feasible. Best case scenario means keeping one hundred percent of the take. Worst case scenario means packing up in a hurry.</p>
