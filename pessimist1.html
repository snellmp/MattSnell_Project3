					<p>Okay, so itâ€™s fucking disgusting. Call it the first of many mistakes, but the bugs are actually lizards. You've got a line on wholesale chameleons from Louisiana, get 'em for 15 cents apiece and sell them to kids on the midway at 75. Which of course means trailing the circus all over the country with your stock stuffed squirming into a violin case.

					It's hard to explain.

					<p>Start with the violin case. You carry it because the world is suspicious of your line of business. Hoteliers frown on it, probably because some bugs inevitably get loose when you tie 'em to their little leashes to prep for a show. You're pretty good at it but nobody's perfect. The case is a bit of misdirection that matches your shabby suit and depressingly empty valise.</p>

					<p>You don't do this for the money. You don't do it for respect. You don't do it for the sense of community, because even circus folk give you the stink eye. They expect to be paid privilege, their word for a cut of your take, in exchange for a piece of the patch. Turns out you don't really have a good reason for what you do. It's just proven possible to move through life like this, so here you are.</p>
